PROBLEMS FACED :

Issue:
While constructing the website, we encounter frequent error messages attributed to server limitations, causing a complete halt in our website development process. The problem primarily arises when using 000webhost for hosting.

Solution:
From completing the site activities for 30 minutes that, can bypass this error. If our website building activities cannot be completed within this 30-minute window, the recommended course of action is to log out or close the website for a subsequent 30-minute period. During this downtime, no action should be taken on the website. After the 30-minute pause, the server will reactivate, allowing us to resume our website development activities for another 30-minute session. This approach should help mitigate the persistent server error problem during website construction.
